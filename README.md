# Cyber
Image Encryption and Decryption with XOR Operation
Overview
This project implements a basic image encryption and decryption system using the XOR operation for data obfuscation. The program allows users to select an image file and then apply encryption or decryption by entering a key in a graphical user interface (GUI).

The XOR operation is a simple, reversible cryptographic technique where each byte of the file is modified based on a given key. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it easy to restore the original image.

Key Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Java Swing for easy interaction.
Image Encryption and Decryption: Uses the XOR operation to encrypt/decrypt image data.
User Input: Users can provide a custom key for encryption and decryption through a text field.
File Selection: Allows users to select an image file from their filesystem for encryption/decryption.
Technologies Used
Java 8 or higher: The project is written in Java.
Swing: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
XOR Encryption: A simple, reversible encryption method where each byte of the image data is XORed with a provided key.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher: Ensure that you have Java installed. You can download it from Oracle's website.
IDE: Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyber-security-image-encryption.git
cd cyber-security-image-encryption
Running the Program
Open the project in your IDE.
Compile and run the ImageOperation.java class.
When the program starts, a window will appear with a button and a text field.

Enter the key: Type an integer value into the text field. This key will be used for both encryption and decryption.
Select an Image: Click the "Open Image" button to select an image file. The image data will then be encrypted or decrypted based on the provided key.
Encrypting/Decrypting an Image
The encryption/decryption process works by XORing each byte of the image data with the provided key. The key can be any integer, and the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the image.

Example Workflow:
Start the program and enter a key in the text field (e.g., 123).
Click the "Open Image" button to select an image file (e.g., image.jpg).
The image will be encrypted or decrypted based on the XOR operation with the provided key.
A dialog box will appear with the message "Done" once the process is complete.
Code Structure
ImageOperation.java: Contains the main logic for the XOR encryption and decryption operation.
operate(int key): The method that performs the encryption/decryption by reading the image file, applying the XOR operation to each byte, and writing the modified data back to the file.
main(String[] args): Sets up the GUI and handles user input (key and image selection).
Example Screenshot of the GUI
The GUI will look something like this:

Text Field: Enter an integer key for encryption/decryption.
Button: Click to open the file chooser and select an image for encryption or decryption.
(This is a placeholder image; you can replace it with a real screenshot)

Security Considerations
XOR Encryption: The XOR operation is a very basic form of encryption and is not suitable for protecting sensitive data. For real-world applications, stronger cryptographic algorithms like AES or RSA should be used.
Key Management: The provided key is a simple integer. In production environments, more secure key management techniques are recommended to prevent unauthorized decryption.
